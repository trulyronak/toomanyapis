# Too Many APIs

This repo has a bunch of apis that have been configured with optic.

This does not contain every repo as documented on [docs.optic.com](https://docs.optic.com), as my mac wasn't able to run all of the development dependencies, and therefore I used temporary docker containers instead.

`api start` in any folder to run optic and the api (you will need to download the dependencies first)
